   I've always been facsinated with computer systems, and the things they can do, so coding was always a big interest of mine, I used to make mods for minecraft when I was in the seventh grade and one day I came to the realization that I could create something like that one day, and every since that moment I've been interested in how to build and operate programs and other things in an online enviornment, so of course once I heard about Flatiron I figured it would help out alot with starting a career in fields related to these topics.
